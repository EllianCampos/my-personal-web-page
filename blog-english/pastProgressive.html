            <h2>Spelling rules </h2>
            <p>
                To form the Past Progressive, we use the Past Simple of the verb ToBe followed by the “ing” form of the main verb. Be careful with the rules 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    If the verb ends with “e”, we replace it with “ing” 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Example: Work => working 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    "vowel + consonant" we double the consonant and add "ing" 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Example: Run => running  
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the verb ends with “ie”, we replace it with “y” and add “ing” 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Example: Lie => Lying
